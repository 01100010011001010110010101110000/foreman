Generally, you need the following things installed:

* Puppet
* rake >= 0.84

to get latest "stable" version do:

git clone git://github.com/ohadlevy/gni.git gni
cd gni
git checkout -b origin/master
git submodule update --init

if you want to share the database with Puppets (storeconfig) edit config/database.yml and configure the production database to point to the same database, if not, you can use any other database rails support.

type:
RAILS_ENV=production rake db:migrate
./script/server -e production

the following URLs might be intersting:
http://localhost:3000/ for really basic webgui
http://localhost:3000/unattended/kickstart will return a kickstart for RHE3-5 / Fedora (and CentOS etc)
http://localhost:3000/unattended/preseed will return a preseed file for usage with Debian/Ubuntu

For jumpstart support, see the files in the extras/jumpstart directory
http://localhost:3000/unattended/jumpstart_profile returns a dynamic profile
http://localhost:3000/unattended/jumpstart_finish returns the finish script
http://localhost:3000/hosts/externalNodes?fqdn=<host fqdn> will return a yaml output for puppet to use.

If you are currently using Store Configs with Puppet and would like your Operating Systems and Environment populated from your puppet DB you can use the following Rake Tasks:

RAILS_ENV=production rake puppet:migrate:populate_hosts # Migrate your puppet based hosts information to GNI

However, if you are NOT using store configs and you still want the puppet node information in the database you can import it by:
RAILS_ENV=production rake puppet:import:hosts_and_facts

this by default will use the puppet vardir (as defined in puppet.conf) if you wish to use another directory, use dir=/dirname.
